        This week, I learned a lot about the basic functions of HTML.
        Although there is a "most used" list of attributes that can be used,
        such as the header, paragraph, list functions, etc., there are almost endless
        variations of ways to "style" the page. For example, Lab 3 had us write multiple 
        pages that consisted of images, forms, and other media that slightly exceeds the 
        basic collection of tools available.<br>
        <br>

        Besides the textbook(obviously), I have found the tutorials and documentation on 
        w3schools to be really helpful. For example, I quickly learned how to make a hyperlink
        by reading <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">this article</a>, and
        anything else I really want to do.<br>
<br>
        Speaking of hyperlinks, I think my favorite (or, most useful) tool so far has been the "a" tag.
        At first, I assumed that it was really only for direct website links. But, after testing it out a 
        few ways, I've learned that it does link- but not just to websites! It can be used to move to a certain 
        section of a page, an image, to initiate an email, and more.<br>
        <br>

        However, the 'a' tag isn't that useful for inserting pictures. For example:<br>
        This code seems the most straightforward in inserting a photo via link:<br>
        'img src='https://cdn.britannica.com/q:60/84/206384-050-00698723/Javan-gliding-tree-frog.jpg' alt='frog smiling'<br>
        <br>
        Versus doing all that inside an 'a' tag:<br>
        a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/q:60/84/206384-050-00698723/Javan-gliding-tree-frog.jpg"<br>
            img src="smilingfrog" alt="frog" style="width:42px;height:42px;"<br>
            /a <br>
        <br>

            Most of the examples in this post originated from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp">here.</a> <br>
